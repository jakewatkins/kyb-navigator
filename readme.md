# Navigator keypad
This is my attempt at creating a wireless macro keypad to augment my wireless Corne keyboards.  The goal is to create a macro keypad with a dislay, led back lighting and led per key lighting on MX switches.  To make things simple (I think) I want to use the same Nice!Nano controller the Corne uses so I get bluetooth and usb-c out of the box.  Further I should be able to use ZMK to setup the firmware and perform the keyboard mappping sense this will basically be a Corne with fewer keys.

Total overkill for a macro keypad. 
The plan is to use ErgoGen to create the layout and produce the files KiCAD needs to create the PCB.
